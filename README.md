#### IDPL-LSPOD Description
It has 30,138 images, each image containing a line of real Persian text.

50% of the images are generated with a white background, 40% with a noisy background and 10% with a textured background.

To increase the similarity of images with real images, we have added distortion and blur to 10% of the total images.

To generate images, 11 common Persian fonts with 2 font styles and 7 font sizes have been used.

To record image information, we have created a file that has 7 columns and 30,138 rows, each row corresponding to an image.
